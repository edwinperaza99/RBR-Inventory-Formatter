# RBR Inventory Formatter

RBR Inventory Formatter is a modern web application developed to optimize inventory management at the Pollak Library circulation desk. This tool automates the processing of `.xls` files generated by the Alma library system, removing unnecessary columns, adding custom fields (e.g., user initials, processing date), and preparing the data for printing.

The application has improved inventory processing speed by 200%, enabling staff to process six reading lists per hour instead of two. It showcases a robust architecture built with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and various other modern libraries and tools.
